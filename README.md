This repository created to disscus the parallel process of the path-finding algorithm A* and a summary of the  in this algorithm

# the setting up process
in the process of parallelism for the c++ code we had to download a TDM-GCC-64 in order to run in parallel and allow it display it results, and adding flag "-fopenmp".
